# A my_flet_app Flet app

An example of a minimal Flet app.

To run the app:

```
flet run [app_directory]

```

In Linux, the FilePicker control depends on Zenity when running Flet as an app. This is not a requirement when running Flet in a browser.

To install Zenity on Ubuntu/Debian run the following commands:

sudo apt-get install zenity
